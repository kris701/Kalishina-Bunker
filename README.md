# Kalishina Bunker
This was a small map design project that i made for the game Garrys Mod. I have something for making bunker maps, so after i had made the [Shika Bunker Map](https://github.com/kris701/Shika-Bunker) i was already coming up with ideas for another one. This one was to be more advanced however, more optimized geometry so that it runs better than the other map. A launchable missile, small events happening, etc.
